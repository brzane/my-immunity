# My immunity
## Overview
my-immunity is an knowledge base system written in Python and Jupyter Notebook suggesting diet plan and tips to increase immunity , this project was built as college project for Knowledge based systems subject.
## Expert System
In artificial intelligence, an expert system is a computer system emulating the decision-making ability of a human expert. Expert systems are designed to solve complex problems by reasoning through bodies of knowledge, represented mainly as ifâ€“then rules rather than through conventional procedural code. Expert systems were among the first truly successful forms of artificial intelligence (AI) software. An expert system is divided into two subsystems: the inference engine and the knowledge base. The knowledge base represents facts and rules. The inference engine applies the rules to the known facts to deduce new facts. Inference engines can also include explanation and debugging abilities.
## What the projcet contains:
1- CLI for intrecating with system.<br>
2- CSV file contains the knowledge base (dishes with its attributes).<br>
3- Detailed report about the knowlede base collection and how the system was implemented(in arabic).
## How to use this project:
this project was written in python (Jupyter notebook) , so you can clone the repo and run the code using Jupyter notebook or VSCODE or Pycharm and happy hacking :)
